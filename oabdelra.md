My name is Osama Abdelrazek, and I am a robotics engineer and a Ph.D. student with a strong interest in robotics and teleoperation systems. 

My research interests include developing advanced control systems, digital twins, and AI-driven predictive tools for robotic applications. 

I have worked on projects involving industrial robots and teleoperation frameworks. 

From this class, I expect to deepen my understanding of software engineering practices and research methodologies, specifically in designing, developing, and testing software tools for real-world applications. 

I aim to explore how software engineering principles can be applied to improve the reliability, scalability, and performance of robotics systems.

In terms of research, I would like to review studies and advancements in software engineering for real-time systems, robotics control frameworks, and AI-enhanced development tools. 

For my class project, I am particularly interested in working on tools or methods that enhance collaborative software development in robotics or improve CI/CD pipelines for high-performance robotic applications.
