# Research interests
I have a wide range of research interests, but most of my experience has been associated with reliability engineering. 

# What you expect from the class
In a broad sense, I expect to gain a better understanding of different architectural styles and patterns in software or have an understanding of the various tradeoffs in designing a software, common and best practices.

# What kind of software engineering research you want to review
I don't think I have enough experience to make a fair judgement. Modern trends or optimization methods might be interesting. 

# What type of software development tool or research you'd like to work in your class project
I haven't decided on a project yet but I am most comfortable using the python programming language. That said, I'm also trying to gain more experience with C#.
