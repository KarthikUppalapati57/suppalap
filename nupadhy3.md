My name is Nagendra Upadhyay, and I am a gradute student for Computer Science. I have experience in full-stack web development, machine learning, and building robust APIs. My goal is to better my understanding of advanced software engineering techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.

I do not have a research topic as I am following the coursework only path for the masters degree.

## Expectations from the Class

I expect to:
- Gain hands-on experience with advanced software engineering techniques and the great topics that are to be discussed in the class.
- Learn how to implement these techniques through projects and be able to use them in real-world scenarios.
