# About Me

Hi, I'm Gasser Elkhodary, and I am a AI engineer and a Ph.D. student with a strong interest in robotics, AR/VR, and teleoperation systems.

My research interests include developing advanced AR/VR interfaces for robotics, and AI-driven predictive tools for robotic applications.

I have worked on projects involving industrial robots, teleoperation frameworks, and immersive AR/VR environments for enhanced human-robot interaction.

From this class, I expect to deepen my understanding of software engineering practices and research methodologies, specifically in designing, developing, and testing software tools for AR/VR-enhanced robotics applications.

I aim to explore how software engineering principles can be applied to improve the usability, interactivity, and performance of AR/VR systems in robotics.

In terms of research, I would like to review studies and advancements in software engineering for AR/VR systems, robotics control frameworks, and AI-enhanced development tools.

For my class project, I am particularly interested in working on tools or methods that enhance the integration of AR/VR into teleoperation systems or improve real-time collaboration in immersive robotics environments.
